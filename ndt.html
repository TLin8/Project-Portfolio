            <h2>Captivating Performance & Specialized Microsite</h2>
            <p>"Now here, Now always" is a captivating contemporary dance theater performance, inspired by Nederlands
                Dans Theater, that pushes boundaries and explores themes resonating deeply with modern audiences through
                dynamic choreography, evocative storytelling, and immersive visuals. My team of six collaborated to
                create a specialized microsite aimed at providing audience members with a comprehensive understanding of
                the theme while enabling convenient ticket booking and seamless program viewing. Through careful design
                and functionality, we ensured that the process was seamless for all visitors, making it easy for them to
                secure their seats for this remarkable performance.</p>

            <h2>Direction</h2>
            <p>Who: Our target audience comprises individuals well acquainted with contemporary dance theater,
                particularly the works of Nederlands Dans Theater.
                What: The microsite emphasizes visual engagement while minimizing reliance on micro-interactions. It
                presents concise descriptions of the show, offering insights into its thematic elements. Given the
                performance's three play periods, the site displays comprehensive information on each segment.
                Why: We selected visual elements to effectively convey the complexities of humanity, intending to
                resonate with frequent dance audiences through concise yet compelling content.

            <h2>Project Overview: Research to Development</h2>
            <p>We began our project by thoroughly researching the preferences of our target audience and delving into
                the thematic essence of "Now here, Now always." Through collaborative brainstorming sessions, we
                generated design concepts that captured the essence of the performance while staying true to
                contemporary design principles.

                Utilizing Figma, we developed wireframes, prototypes, and a mockup to visualize the microsite's layout
                and functionality before diving into HTML and CSS coding. This iterative design process ensured seamless
                navigation and optimal user experience across various devices.

                During the development phase, HTML and CSS were employed to translate our design vision into a
                responsive, functional prototype. Rigorous testing and debugging were conducted to address compatibility
                issues and ensure cross-platform accessibility.

            <h2>Effective Teamwork for Microsite Success</h2>
            <p>Throughout the project, effective communication and teamwork were essential, allowing us to coordinate
