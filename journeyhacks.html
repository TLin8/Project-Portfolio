            <h2>SproutfulAI: Gamifying Mental Wellness</h2>
            <p>SproutfulAI emerged from a half-day hackathon focused on mental health improvement. Our team of four
                recognized the need for more engaging approaches to mental well-being, leading us to develop this
                AI-powered app to gamify breathing exercises. Users engage in unique exercises with each login, while
                the rewarding feature of watering a virtual sprout incentivizes regular practice. With a sleek design
                and interactive elements, SproutfulAI offers a fun and effective solution for enhancing mental wellness
                in a short time frame.</p>

            <h2>Design Lead: Crafting Engaging Interfaces</h2>
            <p>As the design lead, I led the creation of mockups using Figma, with a focus on crafting a user-centric
                interface that prioritized engagement and aesthetic appeal. I collaborated closely with team members,
                actively listening to feedback and critiques to iterate on the design, ensuring its effectiveness in
                promoting mental well-being. Additionally, I played a crucial role in integrating the OpenAI API to
                provide more personalized and unique breathing exercises, thereby enhancing the overall functionality of
                the app.</p>

            <h2>From Ideation to Implementation</h2>
            <p>After thorough research and ideation, we transitioned into the design phase. Utilizing Figma, I crafted
                mockups for my teammates to use as a guide during the development phase. This collaborative process
                facilitated a seamless transition from design to code, resulting in a functional project that reflected
                our shared vision.</p>

            <h2>Hackathon Success: Validating Impactful Solutions</h2>
            <p>After the hackathon, our team was chosen as one of the winners, which ultimately validated our ability to
                deliver impactful solutions under tight deadlines. This project provided us with invaluable insights
                into effective teamwork and time management. Moving forward, our roadmap includes implementing further
                enhancements, such as user authentication and calendar pages to keep track of users' completed days.
                Overall, we aim to enhance user engagement and continue focusing on making a difference in mental
                wellness.</p>
