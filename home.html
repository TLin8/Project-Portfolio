            <p>As a dynamic business student with a passion for design and innovation, I thrive on combining analytical
                insight with creative imagination. With experience in utilizing tools like Figma and the Adobe Creative 
                Cloud suite, including Photoshop, Illustrator, and Premiere, I've crafted intuitive interfaces for hackathon 
                projects and honed abilities in time management, teamwork, and UX/UI design. <br><br> My journey reflects adaptability 
                and innovation across various domains, from design to business. Currently pursuing a joint major in Business 
                Administration and Interactive Arts & Technology at Simon Fraser University, I'm eager to leverage my diverse 
                experiences and technical skills to make an impact at the intersection of technology, design, and business.</p>

            <h3>Project 1</h3>
            <p>The process analysis of the SproutfulAI project showcases my ability to conceptualize, design, and
                execute a solution that addresses a real-world problem while emphasizing user engagement and experience.

                Conceptualization and Ideation:
                The project stemmed from recognizing the need to make mental health improvement more engaging and
                accessible. Inspired by the notion that traditional methods can be mundane, we aimed to gamify breathing
                exercises to encourage wider adoption. This initial insight drove the ideation phase, where we
                envisioned SproutfulAI as a solution to make mental wellness enjoyable through interactive elements.

                Design and Development:
                Utilizing React, TailwindCSS, and the OpenAI API, we crafted the app's architecture and interface to
                prioritize user engagement and aesthetic appeal. The iterative design process involved refining UI
                elements to create a calming environment conducive to mental wellness activities. Integration of the
                OpenAI API enabled the app to generate unique breathing exercises tailored to each user interaction,
                enhancing personalization and novelty.

                Execution and Iteration:
                Throughout the hackathon, effective teamwork and time management were pivotal in actualizing our vision.
                Collaborative efforts ensured the seamless integration of features such as the sprout watering mechanism
                and dynamic breathing exercises. Regular feedback loops enabled continuous refinement, resulting in a
                responsive and visually appealing UI that enhances user experience.

                Achievements and Future Enhancements:
                Securing second place in the hackathon validated our approach and showcased our ability to deliver
                impactful solutions under tight deadlines. Moving forward, our roadmap includes implementing user
                authentication, background music for ambiance, a calendar feature to track progress, and gamification
                elements such as the sprout's health indicator. These enhancements aim to further enrich user engagement
                and foster long-term adherence to mental wellness practices.

                Ethos Connection:
                The SproutfulAI project exemplifies my commitment to blending creativity with technology to address
                societal challenges effectively. It underscores my proficiency in UI/UX design, frontend development,
                and collaborative problem-solving. By demonstrating the iterative design process, effective utilization
                of resources, and a user-centric approach, SproutfulAI embodies the ethos of innovation, empathy, and
                excellence that I strive to uphold in all my endeavors.

        <div class="project">
            <h3>Project 2</h3>
            <p>Design Statement:
                Our objective was to create a captivating and informative microsite for "Now here, Now always," catering
                to contemporary dance theatre enthusiasts, particularly those familiar with Nederlands Dans Theater. The
                aim was to provide prospective audience members with a comprehensive understanding of the performance's
                theme while enabling ticket booking and program viewing.

                Direction:
                Who: Our target audience consists of individuals well-versed in contemporary dance theatre, specifically
                the works of Nederlands Dans Theater.
                What: The microsite prioritizes visual engagement with minimal reliance on micro interactions. It offers
                concise descriptions of the show, providing insights into its thematic elements. Given the performance's
                three distinct acts, the site furnishes detailed information on each segment.
                Why: We selected appropriate visual elements to effectively convey the nuanced complexities of humanity,
                aiming to resonate with frequent dance audiences through concise yet compelling content.

                Process Analysis:
                Our project commenced with thorough research into the target audience's preferences and the thematic
                essence of "Now here, Now always." Collaborative brainstorming sessions facilitated the ideation of
                design concepts that encapsulated the performance's essence while adhering to contemporary design
                principles.

                Utilizing Figma, we developed wireframes, prototypes, and a mockup to visualize the microsite's layout
                and functionality before diving into HTML and CSS coding. This iterative design process ensured seamless
                navigation and optimal user experience across various devices.

                During the development phase, HTML and CSS were employed to translate our design vision into a
                responsive, functional prototype. Rigorous testing and debugging were conducted to address compatibility
                issues and ensure cross-platform accessibility.

                Effective communication and teamwork were pivotal throughout the project lifecycle, enabling us to
                synchronize our efforts and navigate challenges collaboratively. Regular checkpoints and milestone
                evaluations facilitated continuous improvement, resulting in a microsite seamlessly integrating
                captivating visuals with informative content.

                By meticulously adhering to the principles of user-centric design and leveraging our collective
                expertise in HTML, CSS, and design principles, we successfully crafted a microsite that embodies our
                ethos of creativity, innovation, and excellence.
